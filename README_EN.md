## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**:
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/) is required to run the project. You can check if it's already installed with:
      ```bash
      python --version
      ```
    - If not installed, download and install the recommended version.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Copy the repository URL and run the following command in the terminal:
      ```bash
      git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
      ```
    - Navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>
      ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all necessary dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
    - Configure the Twilio environment variables directly in the code or development environment. The required variables are:
        - `TWILIO_SID`
        - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
        - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

5. **Start the Flask Server**:
    - Run the `app.py` script to start the Flask server:
      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```

    - Ensure the server is running and accessible via the URL configured in Twilio for the webhook.

## üåê Deploy

For a production environment, consider hosting the project on a hosting service such as Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud. Be sure to configure environment variables and webhooks as needed.
